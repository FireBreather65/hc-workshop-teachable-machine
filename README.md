## Inspiration
This is my submission for Hack Club's [Teachable Machine workshop](https://workshops.hackclub.com/teachable_machine/)! I wanted to try something new, and thought that this would be a great way to try a new project and learn some more about machine learning.

## Features
As the demo video shows, you can test out my machine by posing yourself with and without a pillow and viewing the results. The UI choices are very simple, because I want the user to focus on the machine and not the site.

## Technologies
This website was built with HTML and CSS on my end, with JavaScript generated by Google to display the machine.

## What I learned
This was my first time working with machine learning, so I learned quite a bit about that during this project. This is also the first project I've created a working demo video for (shown above).
