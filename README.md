This is my submission for Hack Club's [Teachable Machine project!](https://workshops.hackclub.com/teachable_machine/) It took about an hour of constant work to design and code.

This was my first time working with machine learning, so I learned quite a bit about that during this project. This is also the first project I've created a working demo video for (shown above).
